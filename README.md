> Async-rendering & data-fetching for universal React applications.

React Resolver lets you **define data requirements _per-component_**
and will **handle the nested, async rendering on both the server & client for you.**

For example, the following will load & provide `this.props.user` for the
`UserProfile` component:

```js
import { resolve } from "react-resolver";

@resolve("user", function(props) {
  return http.get(`/api/users/${props.params.userId}`);
})
class UserProfile extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { user } = this.props;
    ...
  }
}
```

This is the equivalent to asynchronously loading `user` and providing it to
the component as if it were provided directly:

```xml
<UserProfile user={user} />
```

This makes components _pure_, _stateless_, and _easy to test_ as a result.
